pwd: pwd [OPTION]
    Print the name of the current working directory.

    Displays an error message if an invalid option is given or the directory 
    cannot be read.

    Options:
      -P        print the physical directory, without any symbolic links
      
      --help    displays this help page of pwd, as stored in the file
                `pwd_help.txt'; displays all the options available.
        
    By default, `pwd' behaves as if `-P' were specified.
