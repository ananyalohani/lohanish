cd: cd [OPTION] [DIR]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR. The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.

    Displays an error message if an invalid option is given or the directory is 
    not found.

    Options:
      -P        use the physical directory structure without following
                symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before 
                processing instances of `..'
                
     --help     displays this help page of cd, as stored in the file
                `text_files/cd_help.txt'; displays all the options available.
                displays an error message if a third argument is 
                passed

    The default is to resolve symbolic links in DIR, as if `-P' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR using the system call realpath().
